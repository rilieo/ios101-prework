# Prework - ColorSense
Submitted by: Riley Dou

**ColorSense** is a color detection app designed to analyze and identify the dominant RGB color in any background. Whether you're a designer, artist, or simply someone fascinated by colors, ColorSense provides an innovative way to explore and understand the predominant hues around you.

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## Required Features
The following required functionality is completed:

- Users see a screen with three labels and a button
- Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## Implemented Features
- The text changes to black or white depending on the background color for improved readability
- A bar indicates what RGB color is present most in the background color shown

## App Brainstorming 

Some of my favorite applications are Geometry Dash, Flow, and Discord.

### Favorite features:
**Geometry Dash**
- The secret passageways to obtain coins
- The vibrant and unique colors of the backgrounds of each level
- The different types of obstacles (and the increasing difficulty of getting past the obstacles)

**Flow**
- The different color themes that the game provides
- The different shapes of the maps that make each category of levels interesting and challenging

**Discord**
- Has light and dark mode (and an even darker mode with the new update; think it's called midnight?)
- Can add customized bots

### What app would I make?

An app that checks in for my flights automatically. Presently, this app would support Southwest check-ins because of the airline's *first come first serve* basis for seats.

As someone who regularly books flights to and from Texas, I book the very early morning flights in order to save costs. For Southwest, checking in earlier means a better seat aka a seat at the front of the airplane. But I either forget about checking in or I don't want to wake up *that* early just to get a better seat on the flight (sorry not sorry). Thus, having an app that can check in for me would be a lifesaver for me and possibly others too.

**Features**
- Allows user to input their booking information and retrieve flight details from that
    - Could possibly sync with their email, where most flight updates are sent to
    - Information helps with automatic check-in
- Integrates with Apple wallet for passenger's boarding pass or sent to their email
- Integrates flight details to calendar

**Future Features**
- Allow users to set preferences for seat selection to support check-in processes for other airlines (American, United, etc)
- Voice guided check-in for accessibility
